# Oma

Practical gradually-typed programming language.

## Crates

* `oma` - Stack-based virtual machine.
* `oma-bootstrap` - Bootstrap compiler for Oma into various targets (e.g. JavaScript, VM bytecode, WASM). Goal is to transition to one built in Oma.
* `oma-cli` - Command-line interface to virtual machine and compiler.
* `shu` - Package manager.
